To run the code in these notebooks, first use the `etl.py` script to create the required `sqlite3` database (stored in `b2b_google_analytics.db`).

See the `requirements.txt` for the required `pip`/`conda` packages.  To run any notebook other than the "Data Exploration" one, you will need the [word embedding vectors from spaCy](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg).
